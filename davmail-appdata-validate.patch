   <summary>DavMail POP/IMAP/SMTP/Caldav/Carddav/LDAP Exchange Gateway</summary>
   <description>
-    <p>
-      Ever wanted to get rid of Outlook ? DavMail is a
-      POP/IMAP/SMTP/Caldav/Carddav/LDAP exchange gateway allowing
-      users to use any mail/calendar client (e.g. Thunderbird with
-      Lightning or Apple iCal) with an Exchange server, even from the
-      internet or behind a firewall through Outlook Web
-      Access. DavMail now includes an LDAP gateway to Exchange global
-      address book and user personal contacts to allow recipient
-      address completion in mail compose window and full calendar
-      support with attendees free/busy display. The main goal of
-      DavMail is to provide standard compliant protocols in front of
-      proprietary Exchange. This means LDAP for address book, SMTP to
-      send messages, IMAP to browse messages on the server in any
-      folder, POP to retrieve inbox messages only and Caldav for
-      calendar support. Thus any standard compliant client can be used
-      with Microsoft Exchange. DavMail gateway is implemented in java
-      and should run on any platform. Releases are tested on Windows,
-      Linux (Ubuntu) and Mac OSX. Tray does not work on MacOS and is
-      replaced with a full frame. Tested successfully with the Iphone
-      (gateway running on a server).
+    <p>DavMail is a gateway to Microsoft Exchange supporting standard
+    mail protocols: POP/IMAP/SMTP/CalDav/LDAP.
